Please write a bash script with the commands that would be required to generate two new .NET applications as follows:  
The first application will be a web service called "skdtwebapi" with a two methods: /prompt, which accepts a PUT request with a text body of no more than 2048k, and /skills which accepts a GET request and lists the semantic skills it has. 
The second application will be a command line client of the web service and is called "skdt" and will accept one argument, a file name. The command line application will PUT the contents of the text file to the /prompt method of the first application. 
You may add comments to the script and the generated output but do not add any other text except the bash script. 
You may include commands to build the applications but do not run them. 
Use .NET 7. 
Configuration parameters required for the webapi applicaton will include AzureOpenAIServiceEndpoint, AIServiceKey, AIModel.
