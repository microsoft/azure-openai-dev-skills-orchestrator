I'd like to build a typical Chat Message Applicaton: a simple chat app in React Native that allows the user to manage multiple chat threads.  
Each thred is a different conversation. The app can look very similar to Apple iMessage. 
Key features of the Chat Message application include the ability to create a new chat thread, view the messages in each thread, and to edite and send a new message. 
The frontend for the app will be in typescript and React Native, the backend will be in C# as an Azure Function.
The backend will use a mock function to generate random responses.  The backend will store the chats in an Azure CosmosDB. 
The application will have a setup for local testing and development that allows testing without deployment to Azure. 
Use bicep scripts to create the Azure resources. 
The front end should be able to run entirely in the browser.
