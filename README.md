# AI Dev team

Build a Virtual AI Dev Team using Semantic Kernel Skills

# Goal

From a natural language specification, set out to integrate a team of AI copilot skills into your team’s dev process, either for discrete tasks on an existing repo (unit tests, pipeline expansions, PRs for specific intents), developing a new feature, or even building an application from scratch.  Starting from an existing repo and a broad statement of intent, work with multiple AI copilot dev skills, each of which has a different emphasis - from architecture, to task breakdown, to plans for individual tasks, to code output, code review, efficiency, documentation, build, writing tests, setting up pipelines, deployment, integration tests, and then validation.
The system will present a view that facilitates chain-of-thought coordination across multiple trees of reasoning with the dev team skills.

## Status

### TODO

## Trying it out

Check [the getting started guide](./docs/github-flow-getting-started.md)


## How to run SK plugins with Elsa workflows

Check [the Workflows page](./docs/elsa-workflows.md)

## Proposed UX

* Possible UI: Start with an existing repo (GH or ADO), either populated or empty, and API Keys / config for access – once configured / loaded split view between three columns:
  * Settings/History/Tasks (allows browsing into each of the chats with a copilot dev team role) | [Central Window Chat interface with Copilot DevTeam] | Repo browsing/editing
  * Alternate interface will be via VS Code plugin/other IDE plugins, following the plugin idiom for each IDE
  * Settings include teams channel for conversations, repo config and api keys, model config and api keys, and any desired prompt template additions
* CLI: start simple with a CLI that can be passed a file as prompt input and takes optional arguments as to which skills to invoke
* User begins with specifying a repository and then statement of what they want to accomplish, natural language, as simple or as detailed as needed.
  * SK DevTeam skill will use dialog to refine the intent as needed, returns a plan, proposes necessary steps
  * User approves the plan or gives feedback, requests iteration
  * Plan is parceled out to the appropriate further skills
  * Eg, for a new app:
    * Architecture is passed to DevLead skill gives plan/task breakdown.
    * DevLead breaks down tasks into smaller tasks, each of these is fed to a skill to decide if it is a single code module or multiple
    * Each module is further fed to a dev lead to break down again or specify a prompt for a coder
    * Each code module prompt is fed to a coder
    * Each module output from a coder is fed to a code reviewer (with context, specific goals)
    * Each reviewer proposes changes, which result in a new prompt for the original coder
    * Changes are accepted by the coder
    * Each module fed to a builder
    * If it doesn’t build sent back to review
    * (etc)
