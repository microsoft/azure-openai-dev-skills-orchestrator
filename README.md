# Ai Agents

Build a Dev Team using event driven agents. 
This project is an experiment and is not intended to be used in production.

# Background - initial idea

From a natural language specification, set out to integrate a team of AI agents into your teamâ€™s dev process, either for discrete tasks on an existing repo (unit tests, pipeline expansions, PRs for specific intents), developing a new feature, or even building an application from scratch.  Starting from an existing repo and a broad statement of intent, work with multiple AI agents, each of which has a different emphasis - from architecture, to task breakdown, to plans for individual tasks, to code output, code review, efficiency, documentation, build, writing tests, setting up pipelines, deployment, integration tests, and then validation.
The system will present a view that facilitates chain-of-thought coordination across multiple trees of reasoning with the dev team agents.

# Emerging framework - Ai Agents

While building the dev team agents, we stumbled upon few patterns and abstractions that we think are usefull for building a variety of agentic systems.
At the moment they reside in `src/libs/Microsoft.AI.DevTeam`, but we plan to move them to a separate repo and nuget package.

## How it works

* User begins with creating an issue and then stateing what they want to accomplish, natural language, as simple or as detailed as needed.
* Product manager agent will respond with a Readme, which can be iterated upon.
  * User approves the readme or gives feedback via issue comments.
  * Once the readme is approved, the user closes the issue and the Readme is commited to a PR.
* Developer lead agent responds with a decomposed plan for development, which also can be iterated upon.
  * User approves the plan or gives feedback via issue comments.
  * Once the readme is approved, the user closes the issue and the plan is used to break down the task to different developer agents.
* Developer agents respond with code, which can be iterated upon.
  * User approves the code or gives feedback via issue comments.
  * Once the code is approved, the user closes the issue and the code is commited to a PR.
